# Meanie Roadmap

## Currently being worked on

### Account module
The account module will be a full-stack solution to register and login users. It will use token based authentication, and have integration with oAuth providers like Google, Facebook, Twitter, Github, etc.

### Basic backend mock module
The backend mock module will be a simple Angular module for mocking calls to your backend. It will make use of Angular mocks, but will have some helper services and pre-defined mock routes as examples.

### Update package.json with proper author details
We want to read your personal details from your GIT settings, so that when you create a new Meanie project, it will automatically populate your package.json file with your details in it.
